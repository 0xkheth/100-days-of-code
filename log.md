# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **Version 1 - Getting Started** for the Introductory Course on [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/).

**Thoughts:** My goal is to put in 2 solid hours every day for 100 days. Started coding later during the day and could only code for an hour due to a meeting. I'm hoping this time I can focus on building momentum and being consistent to reach 100 days.
