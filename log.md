# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **Version 1 - Getting Started** for the Practical JavaScript Introductory Course on [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/).

**Thoughts:** My goal is to put in 2 solid hours every day for 100 days. Started coding later during the day and could only code for an hour due to a meeting. I've attempted to code for 100 days straight and failed many times. I've attempted Watch and Code 4-5 times and always gave up in the middle. I'm hoping to focus on building momentum and being consistent to reach 100 days. What I am doing differently this time is publicly committing myself to push through.

### Day 1: November 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *Attacking delusion* under **The computer's perspective - Interlude**. 

**Thoughts:** Before I started coding I spent some time organizing thoughts which had occurred to me about programming yesterday and today. Previously I didn't give myself enough time for reflection and rushed through the task at hand. Retrospectives, even when it comes to emotions, cannot be brushed aside. I felt pretty anxious during the whole hour--most likely it had to do with not getting enough sleep the day before. I'll need to create better situations where it'll be easier for me to make coding into a lasting habit.
