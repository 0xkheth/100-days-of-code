# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: November 22, 2021 (Actual Date: December 7, 2021)

**Today's Progress**: *Setup optimal coding environment for deep work on a different machine* (Mac to Ubuntu). **Installed Git and learned how to use Git on CLI**.

**Thoughts:**

1. I've been taking care of what's urgent and that took me away from sticking with my commitment to complete the #100DaysofCode challenge. Instead of pretending I've done all the work in the meantime, I want to be honest with my progress and attempt at catching up.

2. My readings on deep work has provided the resolve to fully migrate myself off of a Mac onto a Linux machine. The new machine offers zero distraction and I will focus on creative work such as coding which requires deep concentration at a high intensity over a prolonged period.

### Day 13: November 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed up to *Solution Part 3 - A little more research* under **V11 - Click to toggle**.

**Thoughts:** While I wrote written code that makes the toggle button work, I wasn't thorough in terms of researching what string methods to use. I read the descriptions and thought I understood the methods instead of experimenting with the possible list of candidate methods. A W for coding yet another day but a L for rushing instead of building good, tiny habits.

### Day 12: November 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed *Expectation violation* under **V11 - Click to toggle**.

**Thoughts:** 

My succinct solution from yesterday caused problems for the function I was refactoring today. I had to backtrack and change yesterday's and today's code.

Although I've seen the solution from yesterday and have the luxury of experimenting while not totally lost in the dark, I felt I was being punished for not following a) whatever the model answer is or b) not following directions. Funny how perspective can radically change in 24 hours depending on your feelings.

While more time was spent correcting, I've learned more in the end. There's the "model answer", my "succinct" solution, and I know what obstacle you'll face with the "succinct" solution. Feelings are not an accurate judge of whether someone's learning or growing. The path of learning and reaching understanding is littered with dead ends and failures. If I'm stretching myself and am on a steep learning curve, I will constantly feel inadequate. I'm learning to pursue and love that.

A quote from the lesson today:

> When you're getting things to work, just get it to work and you can worry about other options and considerations after you get something to work. If you don't get something to work, you don't have the privilege of talking about other options. The way you sequence that thinking is very important.
>
> You need to have a bias towards action and fixing things instead of a bias towards discussion, debate, and not doing anything.

### Day 11: November 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Wrote down requirements for **V11 - Click to toggle**.

**Thoughts:**

I came up with a solution which was more succinct than the example answer. While there definitely can be tradeoffs down the road, I experimented with the code to make sure it runs as far as I could tell.

While coding, you're constantly having to search and look up things which you did not know before. The best way to understand these new concepts you've just found is to become a master at constructing and testing through small experiments.

### Day 10: November 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: *Investigation Part 2 (and exercise)* WIP under **V10 - Click to delete**.

**Thoughts:** The course is progressively less hand holding and I have to google questions which come up in order to find answers. This being the case, I'm realizing that I should be coding when my creative brain is teeming with activity and not when it's lethargic and wanting to wind down.

### Day 9: November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed *Introduction* under **V10 - Click to delete**.

**Thoughts:** I was surprised at myself being a more active learner than I anticipated. I read MDN documentation thoroughly without being prompted and ended up with more questions than when I started. One of those questions helped me understand that Element.innerHTML and Element.setHTML() could both be used to achieve the same effect with different security tradeoffs. I would not have known that if I didn't do the extra work.

### Day 8: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed *there should be an li for each todo* under **V9 - Escape from the console**.

**Thoughts:**

I came up with solutions with the same output which were different than the one the instructor presented. I wasn't satisfied, took time to explore my curiosity, and tried to figure out why this was the case. I'm encouraged knowing these may be signs that curiosity is what drives me.

Also, it was hard to focus as I was coding after lunchtime. I need to select better hours.

### Day 7: November 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed all requirements for **V8 - Getting data from inputs**.

**Thoughts:** I've switched cities and coding times multiple times these past couple days and it's causing fatigue. I felt detached from reality and what's around me half of today. To calm myself down, I stopped coding right when I felt like I could keep going reminding myself that this is a marathon and I need to be consistent tomorrow. It's become easier to push things aside to dedicate 1 hour of my time solely to coding and that is something to celebrate and itself a big win.

### Day 6: November 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **Interlude - Experimenting with functions**.

**Thoughts:** Tried #100DaysOfCode while moving from city to city and it's doable as long as I dedicate time and make it high priority. I feel confident knowing that this will be something I can do moving around from country to country next year. I am lacking in how I check myself for claims on tests. If there is a statement which is either True or False, collect evidence and build up a case that it is 100% either way using various methods. Once the code I look at becomes complicated, not knowing how something works 100% can prove to be fatal.

### Day 5: November 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *document and element ids* under **V7 - Buttons!**.

**Thoughts:** All great habits start small. Coded an hour a day for almost a week and I FEEL the focus and momentum building. Throughout V6 I was surprised that I was engaged in quality deep work. Being able to fully be immersed and be in the present means more to me than how much progress I am objectively making. My goal is to repeat and continue this "feel good streak" for as long as possible.

### Day 4: November 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *If everything is false, change everything to true* under **V6 - Toggle all**.

**Thoughts:** I am proud of myself for combining if/else statements and for loops to achieve the desired effect. I honestly had no idea where I should begin to solve the problem. I combed through my thinking process to break up big problems into smaller problems and articulated that to myself. This process directed me towards the solution. The tenacity to sit and work through problems patiently gives results.

### Day 3: November 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **V5 - Displaying data better**.

**Thoughts:** Coded for 1.5 hours, again went past 12 to early next morning. Woke up late and was busy with issues I needed to take care of during the day. At night I sat down to code but my housemate wanted to chat and the work got pushed back. If I sleep early/wake up early and keep my morning routine sacred, the day will be much better spent.

### Day 2: November 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **V3 - Using objects**.

**Thoughts:**

Today was the first day I had coded for 2 hours. They weren't continuous but I can improve to make sure I set aside time during the beginning of my day to immerse myself in deep work. I am proud of myself for not cutting it short at 1.5 hours and sticking through the whole 2 hours although I finished late into the night.

I've been doing something that's way out of my comfort zone (in more than 1 way) for the past 3 days and *everything* feels uncomfortable. I'll think back to this moment in the future. This is what a **hard** pivot feels like. This is what a radical **career transition** (career suicide to be honest) feels like. I am attempting to completely change my lane after I've achieved success and mastery in previous lanes.

I remind myself of the growth mindset over and over again. The only yardstick is whether I'm learning or not. **I know with 100% certainty that I've learned something I never knew before today and solved a problem in ways I've never tried before.** I can choose to make myself feel good and remain complacent about continuing to do what I'm comfortable with or sticking my neck out to reinvent myself into someone completely different. Years later, I believe it'll be the compounding of these  moment-by-moment choices I've made that'll have defined my life trajectory.

A technique I've learned today is about checking *expectation and reality* and before running any code to write down what I expect and check it with the reality. I am proud of myself for using this again and again for the quiz and getting it right. Fingers crossed that I can build good habits like this one at a time.

### Day 1: November 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *Attacking delusion* under **The computer's perspective - Interlude**.

**Thoughts:** Before I started coding I spent some time organizing thoughts which had occurred to me about programming yesterday and today. Previously I didn't give myself enough time for reflection and rushed through the task at hand. Retrospectives, even when it comes to emotions, cannot be brushed aside. I felt pretty anxious during the whole hour--most likely it had to do with not getting enough sleep the day before. I'll need to create better situations where it'll be easier for me to make coding into a lasting habit.

### Day 0: November 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **Version 1 - Getting Started** for the Practical JavaScript Introductory Course on [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/).

**Thoughts:** My goal is to put in 2 solid hours every day for 100 days. Started coding later during the day and could only code for an hour due to a meeting. I've attempted to code for 100 days straight and failed many times. I've attempted Watch and Code 4-5 times and always gave up in the middle. I'm hoping to focus on building momentum and being consistent to reach 100 days. What I am doing differently this time is publicly committing myself to push through.
