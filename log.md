# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: November 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *document and element ids* under **V7 - Buttons!**.

**Thoughts:** All great habits start small. Coded an hour a day for almost a week and I FEEL the focus and momentum building. Throughout V6 I was surprised that I was engaged in quality deep work. Being able to fully be immersed and be in the present means more to me than how much progress I am objectively making. My goal is to repeat and continue this "feel good streak" for as long as possible.

### Day 4: November 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *If everything is false, change everything to true* under **V6 - Toggle all**.

**Thoughts:** I am proud of myself for combining if/else statements and for loops to achieve the desired effect. I honestly had no idea where I should begin to solve the problem. I combed through my thinking process to break up big problems into smaller problems and articulated that to myself. This process directed me towards the solution. The tenacity to sit and work through problems patiently gives results.

### Day 3: November 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **V5 - Displaying data better**.

**Thoughts:** Coded for 1.5 hours, again went past 12 to early next morning. Woke up late and was busy with issues I needed to take care of during the day. At night I sat down to code but my housemate wanted to chat and the work got pushed back. If I sleep early/wake up early and keep my morning routine sacred, the day will be much better spent.

### Day 2: November 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **V3 - Using objects**.

**Thoughts:**

Today was the first day I had coded for 2 hours. They weren't continuous but I can improve to make sure I set aside time during the beginning of my day to immerse myself in deep work. I am proud of myself for not cutting it short at 1.5 hours and sticking through the whole 2 hours although I finished late into the night.

I've been doing something that's way out of my comfort zone (in more than 1 way) for the past 3 days and *everything* feels uncomfortable. I'll think back to this moment in the future. This is what a **hard** pivot feels like. This is what a radical **career transition** (career suicide to be honest) feels like. I am attempting to completely change my lane after I've achieved success and mastery in previous lanes.

I remind myself of the growth mindset over and over again. The only yardstick is whether I'm learning or not. **I know with 100% certainty that I've learned something I never knew before today and solved a problem in ways I've never tried before.** I can choose to make myself feel good and remain complacent about continuing to do what I'm comfortable with or sticking my neck out to reinvent myself into someone completely different. Years later, I believe it'll be the compounding of these  moment-by-moment choices I've made that'll have defined my life trajectory.

A technique I've learned today is about checking *expectation and reality* and before running any code to write down what I expect and check it with the reality. I am proud of myself for using this again and again for the quiz and getting it right. Fingers crossed that I can build good habits like this one at a time.

### Day 1: November 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to *Attacking delusion* under **The computer's perspective - Interlude**.

**Thoughts:** Before I started coding I spent some time organizing thoughts which had occurred to me about programming yesterday and today. Previously I didn't give myself enough time for reflection and rushed through the task at hand. Retrospectives, even when it comes to emotions, cannot be brushed aside. I felt pretty anxious during the whole hour--most likely it had to do with not getting enough sleep the day before. I'll need to create better situations where it'll be easier for me to make coding into a lasting habit.

### Day 0: November 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished up to **Version 1 - Getting Started** for the Practical JavaScript Introductory Course on [Watch and Code](https://watchandcode.com/).

**Thoughts:** My goal is to put in 2 solid hours every day for 100 days. Started coding later during the day and could only code for an hour due to a meeting. I've attempted to code for 100 days straight and failed many times. I've attempted Watch and Code 4-5 times and always gave up in the middle. I'm hoping to focus on building momentum and being consistent to reach 100 days. What I am doing differently this time is publicly committing myself to push through.
